# Store Inventory Planner
I have been curious to see the impact a small entity can make for the whole community. The Store Inventory Planner is an app to help local store personnel to keep up with the orders/returns data management without a lot of operational overhead. Also, the app allows one to see the impact of his/her small store activity on a big scale using the analytical capabilities of the app.
# Technologies and tools
The repository contains the code and input data for the project Store inventory update. The project can be used by a small store personnel to maintain the records of the orders (sales and returns) without any need for a technical overhead.
The  original product dataset, which can be found on Kaggle (https://public.tableau.com/app/resources/sample-data)  was used as a product dataset. Some of the csv files from that dataset are int he folder input_csv. The relevant csv files were migrated to local PostgreSql db usign Python scripts which can be found in python_scripts folder.
The rest of the project was performed using the technologies such as Java, Postgresql, SpringBoot, Maven, Bootstrap and front end Html. The project details can be foud in the folder NoteApp.
